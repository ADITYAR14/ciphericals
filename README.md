**Ciphericals** is an educational cryptography library dedicated to Claude Shannon, covering classical to modern ciphers.  
It is designed to help learners explore encryption, decryption, and the underlying principles of cryptography step by step.

## Features

- **Classical Ciphers:** Caesar, Atbash, Vigen√®re, Playfair, Columnar Transposition, and more.
- **Modern Ciphers:** RSA, AES, Diffie-Hellman demos (planned).
- **Interactive Notebooks:** Demonstrations and exercises.
- **Tests Included:** Ensures encryption-decryption correctness.
